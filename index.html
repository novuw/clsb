  <h1>Welcome to My Record of Intentional Cultivation</h1>
  <p>Having been spoonfed and coddled throughout the entirety of my education, I never truly grasped the central principles of my calling. Even my American PhD program has rid itself of written qualifying examinations--a symptom of serious intellectual decay. For the sakes of my self, children, and country, I am ruthlessly pursuing a higher professional standard.</p>
  <p>I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never substitute another's understanding for my own, nor expect another to substitute their own understanding with mine.</p>
